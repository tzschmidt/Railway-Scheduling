# Railway-Scheduling

## About

This project uses Anser Set Programming (ASP), specifically [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/), to solve train scheduling problems. As an framework for instance generation and testing we use [flatland](https://flatland.aicrowd.com/intro.html).

## Directory Structure
- './encodinds/' contains all ASP related files used for the scheduling
- './instances/' contains all instances used for testing
- './tools/' contains all tools and scripts, e.g. for instance generation
